# Smart band data analysis with telegram bot

It's a simple [Telgram](https://web.telegram.org) bot I created to display some statistics from my smart band. I had trouble with the official application of my band, but I managed to get access to the collected data. This data is stored as a few CSV files and updates in a few minutes.

## Requirements:
  - `requirements.txt`
  - *Telegramâ€™s Bot API* - which you can get [here](https://t.me/botfather)
  
## Results:

<img src="/images/result/res3.png" width="220" height="400"/>  
<img src="/images/sleep2.png" width="400" height="200"/>

## File structure:
  - `data` is folder with updatable csv files with data
  - `images`  is folder with generated plots
    - result is folder with screenshots of final version bot
  - `utils` is folder with .py modules to analize data
  - `main.py` is main script with bot
