# Smart band data analysis with telegram bot

It's a simple [Telgram](https://web.telegram.org) bot I created to display some statistics from my smart band. I had troubles with official application of my band, but I managed to get access to data being collected. This data is stored as few csv files and updates a few minutes.

## Requirements:
  - `requirements.txt`
  - *Telegramâ€™s Bot API* - which you can get [here](https://t.me/botfather)
  
## Results:
